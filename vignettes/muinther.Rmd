*muinther* is a package to perform analysis concerning correlation and association between numerous variables (e.g., binary and/or quantitative variables).The package implements two distinct strategies to do that:
1) Pearson's correlation computation and 2) Shannon mutual information method. For both strategies function provide a contingence heatmap matrix with two values for each box : one (p-value of association/correlation test) on a numeric scale and the other one (association/correlation coefficient) on a color scale. This contingence heatmap matrix was built thanks to *ggplot2* package.


The methods implemented in this package are described in detail in the following publications.

Below, we provide a quick-start guide using a data set to illustrate the functionalities of the *muinther* package.

# Quick start

A standard *muinther* analysis takes the following form, where `docs_phenotype_file_1` represents a matrix or data.frame of (of dimension *d* x *n* for *d* observations and *n* studied variables).

Mutual information theory results (computed thanks to `loop()`), exported in the form of a `entropy_outputs` csv object, can be easily be examined using `heatmap()` after csv file transformation into dataframe/matrix (see below and the User's Guide for example).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(muinther)
pearsontable(docs_phenotype_file_1)
loop(docs_phenotype_file_1,1,8)
entropy_outputs <- readr::read_csv('entropy_outputs.csv')
heatmap2(entropy_outputs)
```
